const BASE_RULES = `# AI Design Rules

## Core Philosophy
- Choose the design system from product context first, not visual taste first.
- Prefer one primary design language unless a hybrid has explicit ownership boundaries.
- Avoid generic AI aesthetics: no default purple gradients, no glossy filler, no emoji in functional UI.
- Keep interfaces production-ready, accessible, and structurally coherent.

## UI Principles
1. **Structural, Clear, and Tidy**: Layout must follow a logical hierarchy with intentional alignment and grouping.
2. **Clear and Understandable**: Every element must have a clear purpose and be easily identifiable.
3. **Consistent and Coherent**: Use the same patterns, spacing, and styles across the entire interface.
4. **Purposeful and Relevant**: Only include elements that serve a specific user goal.
5. **Adaptable and Responsive**: Design must work seamlessly across all screen sizes and orientations.

## What Makes a Good Design?
1. **Emphasis**: Highlight the most important elements to guide user attention.
2. **Alignment and Balance**: Ensure a stable, professional look through mathematical or visual grid alignment.
3. **Contrast**: Use value, color, and size to create clear distinctions between elements.
4. **Consistency and Repetition**: Replicate patterns and styles to build familiarity and speed.
5. **White Space**: Use empty space to let the design breathe and prevent cognitive overload.
6. **Hierarchy**: Establish a clear path for the eye to follow, from most to least important.
7. **Unity and Cohesion**: Ensure all parts feel like they belong to a single, purposeful system.

## Beginner Mistakes (DO NOT DO)
- **Not following the design flow**: Skipping wireframes or testing leads to structural failure.
- **Too much complexity/detail**: Over-designing components makes them hard to maintain and use.
- **Too much color**: Excessive palettes distract from the functional hierarchy.
- **No visual hierarchy**: If everything is loud, nothing is heard.
- **No clear purpose**: Every pixel must justify its existence in service of a user goal.
- **Poor usability and spacing**: Cramped or illogical layouts frustrate users.
- **Prioritizing aesthetic over usability**: A "cool" design that is unusable is a failed design.
